- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Raza, an aspiring web dev  ^^)/.
Im learning to fly in the world of coding and development, and making the leap from being a beginner to spreading my wings in this realm. 
My current projects doesnt have the readme files cuz they dont contain best practices; I plan to write them in the intermediate projects that Ill make sooner.
Currently I use vanilla js and css, but im Learning some frameworks such as tailwind and Sass.

You can contact me at Discord (RaZa #4999).
